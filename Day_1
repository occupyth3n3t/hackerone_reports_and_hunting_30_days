Title:IDOR - Scheduled data leak to other accounts By "projectID"

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in the GetNotebookScheduledPaginatedJobs endpoint on backend.singlestore.com. By modifying the projectID parameter in API requests, an authenticated user could access scheduled job information belonging to other users' projects. The API failed to verify whether the requestor had permission to access the specified project.
The vulnerability exposed sensitive information including database names, notebook paths, scheduling details, and infrastructure information. While exploitation required knowledge of valid project IDs, which limited the practical impact, the issue still represented an authorization bypass warranting remediation.

Title:IDOR - Email Verification Bypass via Race Condition

Steps to Reproduce
    Create an account using an attacker email: sijojohnson+attacker@wearehackerone.com.
    Verify the account.
    Go to account settings and update the email address to sijojohnson+attacker2@wearehackerone.com.
    Capture the request using a tool like Burp Suite.
    Send the request to Repeater twice and forward the request.
    In Repeater, modify Request 1 by changing the email to the victim's email (e.g., sijojohnson+victim@wearehackerone.com).
    In Request 2, use the attacker's email (sijojohnson+attacker2@wearehackerone.com).
    Group both requests, select Send Group in Parallel, and send the requests.
    Observe the email inbox—both the victim's and attacker's email addresses will receive the same OTP.
    Go to confirmation page displayed, Enter the OTP (both OTP's are same),
    Capture the request, and replace the email with the victim’s email.
    Send the modified request and observe the response.
    The victim’s email address is now successfully verified.

Title: Replayable Password Change Request Across Sessions.

The report describes a vulnerability in the password change endpoint (PUT /authentication/password) that allows for replay attacks. An attacker who captures a valid password change request can reuse the exact same request later, even from a different session or device, to reset the password again. This vulnerability persists across session renewals and does not require fresh CSRF tokens, timestamps, or other anti-replay mechanisms.
Steps to Reproduce

Log in as a user in Browser A using valid credentials.
Intercept the password change request in Burp Suite.
Send the captured request to Burp Repeater and save it for later use.
Logout from Browser A; attempting to replay the request shows "isAuth:False".
Log in again as the same user in another Browser B.
From Burp Repeater, replay the exact same password change request captured in Step 3.
Observe that the request succeeds and the password is changed, even though it originated from a different session, after the old session was logged out, and reused the exact same body and headers.
