Title:IDOR - Scheduled data leak to other accounts By "projectID"

An Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was discovered in the GetNotebookScheduledPaginatedJobs endpoint on backend.singlestore.com. By modifying the projectID parameter in API requests, an authenticated user could access scheduled job information belonging to other users' projects. The API failed to verify whether the requestor had permission to access the specified project.
The vulnerability exposed sensitive information including database names, notebook paths, scheduling details, and infrastructure information. While exploitation required knowledge of valid project IDs, which limited the practical impact, the issue still represented an authorization bypass warranting remediation.

Title:IDOR - Email Verification Bypass via Race Condition

Steps to Reproduce
    Create an account using an attacker email: sijojohnson+attacker@wearehackerone.com.
    Verify the account.
    Go to account settings and update the email address to sijojohnson+attacker2@wearehackerone.com.
    Capture the request using a tool like Burp Suite.
    Send the request to Repeater twice and forward the request.
    In Repeater, modify Request 1 by changing the email to the victim's email (e.g., sijojohnson+victim@wearehackerone.com).
    In Request 2, use the attacker's email (sijojohnson+attacker2@wearehackerone.com).
    Group both requests, select Send Group in Parallel, and send the requests.
    Observe the email inbox—both the victim's and attacker's email addresses will receive the same OTP.
    Go to confirmation page displayed, Enter the OTP (both OTP's are same),
    Capture the request, and replace the email with the victim’s email.
    Send the modified request and observe the response.
    The victim’s email address is now successfully verified.

Title: Replayable Password Change Request Across Sessions.

The report describes a vulnerability in the password change endpoint (PUT /authentication/password) that allows for replay attacks. An attacker who captures a valid password change request can reuse the exact same request later, even from a different session or device, to reset the password again. This vulnerability persists across session renewals and does not require fresh CSRF tokens, timestamps, or other anti-replay mechanisms.
Steps to Reproduce

Log in as a user in Browser A using valid credentials.
Intercept the password change request in Burp Suite.
Send the captured request to Burp Repeater and save it for later use.
Logout from Browser A; attempting to replay the request shows "isAuth:False".
Log in again as the same user in another Browser B.
From Burp Repeater, replay the exact same password change request captured in Step 3.
Observe that the request succeeds and the password is changed, even though it originated from a different session, after the old session was logged out, and reused the exact same body and headers.

Title: Rails Debug Mode Enabled On ( https://44.208.145.207/testrail/files.md5)

Ruby on Rails web application running in development mode has been identified on a Malwarebytes server at https://44.208.145.207/testrail/files.md5. Running Rails in development mode exposes sensitive system information that should not be accessible in a production environment. This includes information about middleware components and application root paths that could be leveraged by attackers.

Title: Staff with Restricted Permissions Could Access Customer Data After Company Removal
During my research on admin.shopify.com, I discovered that if a customer is associated with a specific company and places an order for that company, but is later removed from the company, staff with restricted company permissions can still access and update the customer's information.

Steps To Reproduce:

    Visit partner dashboard
    Create development store or use existing one.
    Login to admin.shopify.com.
    Invite staff member and assign them Companies > View, Restrict permissions to assigned company locations and customers permissions.
    Create a company and assign a customer to this company.
    Create an order for the company created in step 5 from the customer's account.
    Remove the customer from that company.
    Try to place a personal order with different shipping address for the customer.
    Visit the staff member account's customer tab and see the customer is still present with updated shipping address and is able to manage their personal information as well.

Title: Order More Than Maximum Allowed Quantity

A business logic vulnerability allowed users to bypass product quantity limits (1-20 items) through parameter manipulation. 
While the UI enforced these limits, server-side validation was missing.

Title: Account Takeover in Password Reset Function

A critical authentication bypass vulnerability was present in the password reset functionality of the ███████
website at ███████. The vulnerability allowed attackers to take over any user account without requiring 
access to the victim's phone number or the one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS. The security flaw existedin the 
implementation of the "Forgot Password" feature, where the system was designed to send an OTP to a user's registered 
phone number for verification before allowing password reset. However, the vulnerability arose from inadequate server-side 
validation that relied on client-side responses to determine the success of OTP verification. An attacker could intercept the 
server response using a proxy tool and manipulate the response parameters to bypass the OTP verification step entirely. By changing 
the response status from failure to success and modifying the JSON response body, the attacker could proceed to set a new password for
the victim's account without ever receiving or entering the legitimate OTP. This vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 9.6 
(Critical) and represented a complete failure of the authentication mechanism designed to protect user accounts during the password 
reset process.

Title: .8x8.vc/index.js: Exposed Google Maps API Key Allowing Potential Abuse of Paid Services

We resolved an issue where a Google Maps API key allowed potential unauthorized access to some Google Maps services.
While the API key was intentionally included in client-side code, it lacked proper restrictions to prevent abuse of paid services. 
The potential impact could theoretically lead to API quota consumption and related billing concerns, though actual impact was limited
as no evidence of exploitation was found. Our team promptly validated and addressed the report by implementing appropriate API key 
restrictions where feasible,while accepting other known limitations.

Title: Exceed the maximum number of subscribers using Race Condition 

A race condition vulnerability was discovered in the SingleStore control panel that allowed bypassing the maximum limit of five 
subscribers for alerts. By sending multiple concurrent POST requests to the CreateAlertReceivers endpoint with different 
email addresses, an unlimited number of subscribers could be added despite the UI displaying a restriction message.
The vulnerability was validated, triaged, and assigned a Low severity rating by the SingleStore security team.
The issue has been patched and deployed to production.
